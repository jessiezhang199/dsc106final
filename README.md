Our initiative involves the creation of a website dedicated to introducing the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test and various MBTI personality types. Leveraging a robust dataset sourced from Kaggle, we have successfully implemented a global geographical representation showcasing prevalent MBTI types across different countries. This visualization is complemented by a color legend to facilitate easy identification of personality types. Currently, our focus lies in transitioning between pages seamlessly, opting for a dynamic change-page approach rather than conventional scrolling.

Presently, our primary challenge revolves around implementing a robust mechanism for successfully navigating between website pages. This represents a novel undertaking for our team, introducing complexities that require careful consideration. The intricacy is exacerbated by our unfamiliarity with structuring files optimally for this task. This marks our inaugural attempt at independently generating multiple Svelte files without external guidance. Currently, we are addressing a persistent issue where the initial page fails to transition effectively after subsequent page changes. Our team is actively engaged in resolving this bug to ensure a smooth user experience.
